Hello There! 

This is the my final version of Pong for CSE 210! 

This push includes: 
- Creating the objects 
- Logic for the right paddle (CYAN)
- Logic for the left paddle (RED)
- Scoring for both sides 
- Collision detection and response 
- Increasing in velocity when hitting paddles 

And, one thing I'm rather proud of 
- Changing the color of the ball and the score text when collisions happen! :) 

I hope you enjoy playing! I hopped on Parsec with my friend to play together and he seemed to enjoy it.

OH! And one note before I forget- The CYAN player is controlled using UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT keys. The RED player controls are W, S, A, and D.
